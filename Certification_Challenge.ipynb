This means the very poorest borrowers will pay more than before.\\n- Monthly payments for many borrowers could be higher compared to the outgoing SAVE plan, especially for middle- and lower-income borrowers.\\n- The number of repayment options is being reduced, leaving only the standard plan and RAP for new borrowers after July 1, 2026. This limits flexibility.\\n\\nEasier for Others:\\n- Under RAP, borrowers will no longer see their loan balances grow due to unpaid interest, which was a common problem with previous plans. The government will help ensure that principal balances shrink every month, even for low-income borrowers.\\n- For some middle-income borrowers, monthly payments may be lower than under older plans (but not as low as under SAVE).\\n\\nIn summary: The RAP plan is less generous than the SAVE plan, especially for the lowest-income borrowers, but it does address the issue of growing loan balances.
